# Flash-X Workflows

Repository for Flash-X Workflows. 

Categories of workflows that fall under management of this repository.

1. Data analysis/reproducibility workflows for research articles, papers, etc.
2. Machine learning workflows
3. Workflows using Flash-X container to run on cloud computing environments, and on HPC machines with singularity support

Directory structure is organized based on ```source/Simulation/SimulationMain``` of Flash-X. With the idea that it may live as a submodule under ```source/Simulation/SimulationWorkflows```

### How To

Create a folder for your workflows at the level of specific simulation directory

- Add parfiles, Maplefiles, Dockerfiles, API keys, and provide a README for individual simulations
